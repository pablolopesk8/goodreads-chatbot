# Web Developer Application Challenge

## About the Problem

Help readers evaluate books using facebook messenger chatbot. The conversation should go like this:

## Conversation

1. Welcome the user by using their first name.
2. Ask the user if they want to search books by name or by ID (Goodreads ID).
3. Use Goodreads API to search books.
4. Retrieve a maximum of 5 books and let the user select one of them.
5. Retrieve the selected book’s reviews from Goodreads and use IBM Watson to do a semantic analysis for the most recent reviews.
6. Suggest the user if they should buy the book or not based on the semantic analysis done in the previous step.  

## Specification

Don’t use any chatbot framework or service for doing the task.
You must handle the flow of the conversation by yourself.
Get the best test coverage you can get.
In case you are applying for a mid-level position or higher, you are required to add the deployment script or virtualenv provisioning script to the repo.
In case you are applying for a mid-level position or higher, test coverage should be 60% or more.

> P.S. While you’re doing the challenges, please pick a project that you’ve done in the past and that you’re most proud of. We will be talking about that in the interview. We will be asking you how the project was built, as well as the technical decisions you’ve made while working on the app. You can prepare for this by making a list of the things you’ve done in this project and how it highlights your abilities.
